# BankAccounts
This is a Java Bank program about class inheritance with two types of Bank Accounts. The first type is the Savings Account which makes deposit, 
withdrawal and money transport to another Account. Also it has an interest which is added at the end of ever month.
The second type is the Checkings Account which can also make deposit and withdrawal. But, it has only three free actions.
After those, every other action is charged with 2 extra (euros) and the subtraction takes place at the end of every month.
